# Angular Weather Forecast: Single Page Application (SPA)

## Description
This application was created after going through the Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wqi3@7TdaCkz8YKZ8YFAFNtHZ_VrjduwpbBm_n4iD0lRFp7zxnuse9RO0O7jae9ln-NES/">Learn & Understand Angular JS</a>. This particular project was a guided step-by-step but I've added the usage of Node, built the application in VS Code instead of Brackets.io and tweaked the Bootstrap styling to my personal preferences.
