# Angular Weather Forecast: Single Page Application (SPA)

## Description
This application was created after going through the Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wqi3@7TdaCkz8YKZ8YFAFNtHZ_VrjduwpbBm_n4iD0lRFp7zxnuse9RO0O7jae9ln-NES/">Learn & Understand Angular JS</a>. This particular project was a guided step-by-step but I've added the usage of Node, built the application in VS Code instead of Brackets.io and tweaked the Bootstrap styling to my personal preferences.

## Roadmap
I will not be completing this project via the Udemy course, this is using an antiquated version of Angular and not supported any longer. I hope to continue working on this after I've gone through a different trianing. 

This is discussing Angular JS from initial launch V.1 and as of May 2023, Angular JS is on V.16. 

I'm switching to a different course from Udemy called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/105YbY3@W6am1VXu8Racf6W8IqyMabdFLdTniK14QZhDZUQPquJn2t-2wCEZpEtm4Q91SIFF/">Complete Angular Developer: Zero To Master</a>

npm install angular@1.8.2
